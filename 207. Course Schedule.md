### Course Schedule
There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

Example 1:

Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
Note:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

```cpp
bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<pair<int, int>>& prerequisites) 
{
    vector<unordered_set<int>> graph(numCourses);
    vector<int> degree(numCourses);
    //构建邻接关系，确定每个结点以及以该结点作为前向依赖结点的集合
    for(auto pair : prerequisites)
    {
        graph[pair.second].insert(pair.first);
    }
    
    //统计每个结点的入度（前向依赖的数量）
    for(auto neighbors : graph)
    {
        for(auto neigh : neighbors)
        {
            degree[neigh]++;
        }
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++)
    {
        int j = 0;
        for(; j < numCourses; j++)  //找到入度为0（没有前向依赖）的结点
        {
            if(degree[j] == 0)  
                break;
        }
        
        //如果没有入度为0的结点，则说明存在环依赖
        if(j == numCourses)
            return false;
        
        degree[j] = -1; //将该结点标记为已访问并将以该结点为前向依赖的其他结点的入度减1
        for(auto neigh : graph[j])  
        {
            degree[neigh]--;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
